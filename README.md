# MergeIntegerStream
Merge two integer streams.

Usage Notes
http://localhost:<port>/quiz/merge?stream1=<stream_name_1>&stream2=<stream_name_2>

Other Notes
- For a single instance of the application, if you use different pairs of streams, the data is merged for all the streams. In other words, we don't provide the lowest number per stream pair.
